    <li class='blist'>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) Child elements inherit characteristics from their parents Web can be reduced to boxes (like this one)</li>

    <li class='blist'><div class ='imge'><img src='http://www.asch.org.uk/teaching/webdesign/design/TreeLayout.png' width=400px></div><div class='txtbox'>HTML is based on a tree-like structure. A parent or root webpage represents the trunk and then child or 'branch' pages connect to it, which in turn has child pages. Code should also be structured in a similar way to have divs which contain like elements so that a webpage can be moved around like legos</div>
    </li>
    <li class='blist'> Use classes and css to avoid repetition. Repeating code, is not only time consuming for the programmer, it also makes things harder to change and iterate. Code should work modularly so that a minimum of work needs to be done for a small change. Also modular code runs faster, which is something to be aware of at all stages of coding</li>
